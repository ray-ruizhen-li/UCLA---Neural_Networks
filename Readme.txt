### Project Scope:

The world is developing rapidly, and continuously looking for the best knowledge and experience among people. This motivates people all around the world to stand out in their jobs and look for higher degrees that can help them in improving their skills and knowledge. As a result, the number of students applying for Master's programs has increased substantially.

The current admission dataset was created for the prediction of admissions into the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). It was built to help students in shortlisting universities based on their profiles. The predicted output gives them a fair idea about their chances of getting accepted.


**Your Role:**

Build a classification model using **Neural Networks** to predict a student's chance of admission into UCLA.


**Specifics:** 

* Machine Learning task: Classification model 
* Target variable: Admit_Chance 
* Input variables: Refer to data dictionary below
* Success Criteria: Accuracy of 90% and above
